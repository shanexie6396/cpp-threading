// Notes
// incentives: since having the threads to check and wait all the time is computation heavy,
// we can use unique_lock and std::condition_variable to allow the thread to wait until notify.
// unique meaning: It has unique ownership of the mutex itâ€™s managing.

// ?? Why unique_lock ??
// mutex        =  the raw lock tool (you manage everything yourself)
// lock_guard   =  automatic, simple, safe (no manual unlocks, no flexibility)
// unique_lock  =  automatic but flexible (auto lock/unlock + manual control if needed)

// condition_variable::wait() needs something that can be unlocked and relocked safely while it waits.
// ** Only unique_lock provides that interface.
